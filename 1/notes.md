# Exercise 1.2 notes

Python numbers (ints, floats) have their own built-in methods:

- `as_integer_ratio()` returns a fractional representation
- `is_integer()` returns a bool
- `.numerator` and `.denominator`
- `bit_length()`

Python strings have some interesting built-ins as well:

- `lower()` converts to lowercase

# Exercise 1.4 notes

Python exceptions:

```python3
try:
    # code to try

except ValueError as e:
    # code to handle e
```
